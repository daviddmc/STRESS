This version of the Spatio-Temporal Atlas (STA) was last edited on 02/24/19

This spatio-temporal atlas (fetal brain atlas) and the included parcellations are not intended for medical use and have no warranty. Structures received varying amounts of attention and refinement based on the research goals at the time of creation and thus no guarantees can be made regarding the accuracy or precision of the segmentations, nor the withholding to any particular labeling convention or protocol between structures. Any output derived from the use of these atlases or parcellations shouled be checked in order to validate the accuracy of the results.

Update on 01/08/19 - CRL_Fetal_Brain_Atlas_2017v2

Fixed an error where some segmentations were not correctly gzip'd
("tissue" for STA21-30)

New to this update (02/05/18) "Superbowl edition":

This zip is named CRL_Fetal_Brain_Atlas_2017.zip

EXPANDED ATLAS - 36-38:
	The fetal atlas for gestational ages 36-37 have been reconstructed using additional high-quality fetal MRIs
	An all-new week 38 atlas has also been included in the zip
	To differentiate these versions from previous atlas releases, these are named:
		STA36exp.nii.gz
		STA37exp.nii.gz
		STA38exp.nii.gz
	Because these are new atlas images, new "Olympic edition"-protocol segmentations were created for these images

REGIONAL CORTEX PARCELLATION:
	A regional cortex parcellation (which extends into the white matter) has been added alongside the "Olympic edition" segmentations
	These are named:
		STA21_regional.nii.gz
		STA22_regional.nii.gz
		STA23_regional.nii.gz
		STA24_regional.nii.gz
		STA25_regional.nii.gz
		STA26_regional.nii.gz
		STA27_regional.nii.gz
		STA28_regional.nii.gz
		STA29_regional.nii.gz
		STA30_regional.nii.gz
		STA31_regional.nii.gz
		STA32_regional.nii.gz
		STA33_regional.nii.gz
		STA34_regional.nii.gz
		STA35_regional.nii.gz
		STA36exp_regional.nii.gz
		STA37exp_regional.nii.gz
		STA38exp_regional.nii.gz
	The label structure names are noted below, and an ITKsnap label description file has been included as well
	As usual, we give no gaurantees about the accuracy of these labels. In particular for the 'younger' brains, the surface of the brain is much smoother and so there are fewer landmarks to differentiate regions, especially as it comes to regions in the same lobe or group, such as the border between the superior, middle, and inferior occipital gyri
	These labels were warped initially from the ENA33 neonate atlas (citation below) on to our 36-38 atlases. Then the resulting segmentation was propagated down, week-by-week, to the rest of our atlases.

RENAMED FILES:
	"Olympic edition" segmentations are now named "tissue"
	Note: 21-30 have developing white matter zones/layers, 31-38 don't
	They are now named:
		STA21_tissue.nii.gz
		STA22_tissue.nii.gz
		STA23_tissue.nii.gz
		STA24_tissue.nii.gz
		STA25_tissue.nii.gz
		STA26_tissue.nii.gz
		STA27_tissue.nii.gz
		STA28_tissue.nii.gz
		STA29_tissue.nii.gz
		STA30_tissue.nii.gz
		STA31_tissue.nii.gz
		STA32_tissue.nii.gz
		STA33_tissue.nii.gz
		STA34_tissue.nii.gz
		STA35_tissue.nii.gz
		STA36exp_tissue.nii.gz
		STA37exp_tissue.nii.gz
		STA38exp_tissue.nii.gz

New to this update (11/21/16) "Olympic edition":

CHANGES TO LABELING SCHEME:
	The parcellation scheme (label numbers) has been reorganized
		All atlas images now share the same label key
		The full key can be found below
	Left and right white matter have been separated into separate labels
	Labels for left and right internal capsule have been added to all images
	
REFINEMENT TO PARCELLATIONS:
	"Miscellanous_brain_tissue" has been mostly removed as most of the label was internal capsule
	Developing white matter zones (SP, IZ & VZ) have been removed from STA31-33 because they were not felt to be accurate (differentiation between layers was arbitrary)
		*There are two versions of the STA30 parcellation, one with developing white matter zones, one without*
	Cortical plate was reduced in the region anterior to the corpus callosum (reduced the portion "wrapping" into hemisphere)
	Subplate has been expanded to the appropriate width as per reviewer feedback
	The intermediate zone/ventricular zone has been edited to shrink the ventricular zone in line with reviewer feedback
	Deep gray matter structures have been edited to increase segmentation consistency between gestational ages

New to this update (06/07/16):

	White and gray cerebellum have been recombined because we could not ensure the accuracy of the delineation (very little refinement had been done since initial propagation of the parcellation scheme to this atlas).
	
	The files have been renamed slightly.

New to this update (03/30/16):

ADDED TEMPLATES:
	There are now atlas images and labels for gestational age (GA) weeks 21-37.

DEVELOPING WHITE MATTER ZONES:
	Labels for developing white matter zones have been added for GA 21-33
	This includes left and right "ventricular zone", "intermediate zone" (similar to subventricular zone), and "subplate"
	In these images, label 51 is now "miscellaneous brain tissue", mostly deep gray matter found between the larger subcortical structures

	Note: As the white matter homogenizes in composition during development, the visual differentiation between the layers also decreases. Because of this the accuracy of the developmental layers may not be great for the older brains (i.e. ~STA30). This primarily pertains to the border between intermediate zone and subplate.

ADDITIONAL ADDED LABELS:
	#5: Hippocampal commisure
	#6: Fornix

LABEL REFINEMENTS:
	Many of the labels have been refined to increase accuracy, in particular:
		hippocampus
		caudate
		thalamus
		lentiform
		corpus callosum
		cortical plate
